## Introduction ##

jMonkey Engine (jME) is a high-performance 3D game engine, written entirely in Java, OpenGL is supported via LWJGL. For sound, OpenAL is supported. Input via the keyboard, mouse, and other controllers is also supported.

jME is a community-driven open source project released under the 'new BSD license'. It is currently being used by several commercial game studios as well as by university game classes. With the 2.0 branch now community support, jME 3.0 has emerged quickly in response to higher standards of the next generation in performance and hardware.

## Using JME ##

To get started with JME, you can download the library and sources from the "Downloads" section of this page. Getting the source is recommended since there are examples of almost all of JME's functions in the "jmetest" package. You can find info on how to set up the source and libraries in your IDE in the jme wiki (see below).

You can find documentation, help and a nice community around JME on the jMonkeyEngine Homepage, Wiki and Forum:

## JME Development ##

This googlecode project contains mainly information about jme3 and its development. To get info about the usage of jme2 (and in future jme3) go to the pages listed above. Everybody who thinks that he can contibrute to jme2 or jme3 is very welcome to do so. Please contact the devlopers through this project page.

The issues in this googlecode repository are divided by the project they belong to.
